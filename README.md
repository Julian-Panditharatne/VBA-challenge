U of T SCS Bootcamp VBA Challenge:

This challenge required us to create a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol
- Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
- The stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

Conditional formatting was also used to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Files:

Final_Draft.vb;
The script that was run on an excel Workbook containing information on stocks for each quarter. Comments mention when code was sourced from Class materials or Xpert AI Learning Assistant or other outside sources. Note: the references section of this README file has APA-style citations for these outside sources.
