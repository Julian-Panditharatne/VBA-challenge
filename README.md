U of T SCS Bootcamp VBA Challenge

This challenge required us to create a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol
- Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
- The stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

Conditional formatting was also used to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
